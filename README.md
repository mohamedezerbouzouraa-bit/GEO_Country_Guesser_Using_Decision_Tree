# GEO_Country_Guesser_Using_Decision_Tree
Geo Country Guesser: Simple interactive game built with Python and Tkinter that guesses the country you are thinking of based on 15 geographical, demographic, and political features. Inspired by my deep love for geography, it includes 30 countries across Europe, Africa, and Asia.
I want to mention also that it handles absurd/undeliberate responses (e.g., in Africa=1 and in Europe=1) by continuing asking the stellar questions , and that's thanks to the DecisionTreeClassifier used.
